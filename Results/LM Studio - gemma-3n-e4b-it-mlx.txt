I spent the day traveling between offices, meeting with friends, and observing the city's jubilant reaction to a letter from Monk. We dined, visited various locations including Guildhall and taverns, and witnessed widespread celebrations with bonfires, ringing bells, and people displaying symbolic "rumps." I wrote letters throughout the day, eventually returning home with my wife after witnessing the extraordinary displays of public celebration.
