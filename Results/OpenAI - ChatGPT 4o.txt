I spent the day reading, visiting Westminster Hall, and joining Chetwind on a trip into the City, where we dined, visited offices, and followed news of General Monkâ€™s letter to Parliament. The day ended with widespread celebrations, bonfires, and public joy, which I shared with my wife before heading to bed.
