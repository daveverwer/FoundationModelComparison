I woke late and spent the morning reading my Spanish book about Rome at the office. At noon I went to the Hall where I heard news of Monk's letter to Parliament, then dined on roasted chicken with Chetwind near Temple Bar. We visited Guildhall expecting Monk, went to taverns, and I met with Lock who explained Monk's complaints to Parliament. The evening brought extraordinary celebrations throughout London with bonfires, bell-ringing, and people roasting "rumps" in the streets before I returned home with my wife.1 / 2RetryClaude can make mistakes.
