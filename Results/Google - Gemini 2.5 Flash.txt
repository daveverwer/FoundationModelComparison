I read in my office, then learned of Monk's letter and dined with Mr. Chetwind. I sang in his study, then we went to Guildhall and drank at taverns, witnessing Monk's return. Later, I dined again, and showed my wife the joyful bonfires before we returned home.

I spent the morning reading my Spanish book of Rome, then went to the Hall, where news of Monkâ€™s letter brought sudden joy. I lunched with Chetwind, visited Guildhall, and saw Monk greeted with cheers. The city erupted in bonfires, bells, and celebrations, which I enjoyed with my wife before heading to bed.
