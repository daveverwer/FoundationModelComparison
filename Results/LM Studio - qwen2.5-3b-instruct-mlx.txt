Today, I slept late then went to my office where I read Spanish. In the Hall, men changed from joy to anger upon hearing letters. I attended meetings and dined at various places due to no food availability. At Temple Bar, we dined then drank wine and ale before going to Guildhall. There, Monk's arrival triggered a joyous response from the crowd. We dined further at various taverns and witnessed numerous bonfires along our journey home.
